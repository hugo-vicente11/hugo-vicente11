# 👋 Hey, I’m Hugo Oliveira Vicente

🚀 **Software Engineer | Systems & Infrastructure | C/C++ • Python • Arch | IST Lisbon**

I'm a Computer Science & Engineering student at Instituto Superior Técnico (IST) who thrives on **building scalable backend systems**, **low-level infrastructure**, and **automation that actually works**. Currently running production-grade NixOS and Windows environments as a **Systems Administrator @ IST-RNL**, I balance systems work with my passion for performance-first engineering in C/C++, Python, and Java.

## 🔧 What I Do Best

- 🧠 **Systems Programming** – Think multithreaded, concurrent, persistent backends from scratch (see [`projetoSO2`](https://github.com/HoVeRzzz/projetoSO2))
- ⚙️ **Infrastructure & SysAdmin** – Managing lab-critical infrastructure across Linux/Windows (including NixOS), automating deployments
- 🤖 **AI/ML Foundations** – Certified by DeepLearning.AI + IBM in ML, data science, and AI/cybersecurity
- 🧪 **Problem Solving at Scale** – Built AI solvers like [`AI-Nuruomino-Solver`](https://github.com/hugo-vicente11/AI-Nuruomino-Solver) using DFS + adjacency graphs to optimize search and constraint pruning
- 🛠️ **Tooling & Optimization** – Scripts, tweaks, configs for devs and sysadmins ([`Tweaking`](https://github.com/hugo-vicente11/Tweaking), [`dotfiles`](https://github.com/hugo-vicente11/dotfiles))

## 🔥 Featured Projects

- [`AI Nuruomino Solver`](https://github.com/hugo-vicente11/AI-Nuruomino-Solver)  
  **→ AI puzzle solver** using Backjumping DFS with graph pruning. Smart search, smarter backtracking.

- [`High-performance key-value storage system`](https://github.com/HoVeRzzz/projetoSO2)  
  **→ High-performance key-value storage system** with hashtable, concurrency, parallel I/O, and persistence. Built in C with full client-server architecture.

- [`Car Park Management System`](https://github.com/HoVeRzzz/projetoIAED)  
  **→ Car park management system** built with error handling and billing logic, from CLI to memory management.
